/**
 * The gap this closes: `executeSetup` used to install hooks only, silently
 * less than what `common-rules setup` does from a terminal — confirmed by
 * running the real CLI against a fresh project (skills, .specsfy/) and the
 * MCP tool against another (hooks only, no skills, no .specsfy/) in the
 * same session. `mcp-tool-install.test.ts` already proves the hooks side;
 * this proves the rest of what a real setup delivers.
